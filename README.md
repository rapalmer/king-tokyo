Virtual Version of the King of Tokyo boardgame

Group project created while at ISU. Most of the code written by myself can be found in the GameEngine folder.

Server no longer up and running, but when set-up a user logs in and chooses whether to join or host a game.
The server is then used to group players into matches. Once everyone is in and the game is started it then runs using 
the hosts machine as the game server sending and receiving data from the players. 

King of Tokyo Rules: 
Players choose one of six monsters (Alienoid, Cyber Bunny, Giga Zaur, Kraken, Meka Dragon, and The King; 
in the second edition Cyber Bunny and Kraken are replaced by Cyber Kitty and Space Penguin) which comes 
with a scoring board. The winner is the first player to reach 20 points, or the only player to have any health.

Players throw 6 dice, and may reroll some of them as in the dice game Yahtzee.

Die faces are power, health, attack, 1, 2, and 3. 
With power dice, players collect power tokens to buy power cards with. 
With health dice, players outside Tokyo heal damage done to them. 
With attack dice, players outside Tokyo attack players in Tokyo, or players in Tokyo attack players outside. 
Three 1 dice score 1 point, three 2s score 2, and three 3s score 3. 
Any additional same-numbered die scores 1 additional point.
